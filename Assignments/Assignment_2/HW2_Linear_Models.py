# # Homework 2: Linear Models for Regression and Classification

# Due 10/21 at 11:59pm
# 
# In this notebook, we will be implementing three linear models: linear regression, logistic regression, and SVM. We will see that despite some of their differences at the surface, these linear models (and many machine learning models in general) are fundamentally doing the same thing - that is, optimizing model parameters to minimize a loss function on data.
# 
# **Note: There are two notebooks in Homework 2. Please also complete the other notebook `HW2_Decision_Trees.ipynb` for full credit on this assignment.**

# ## Part 1: Linear Regression

# ### 1.1 Data Exploration

# In part 1, we will use two datasets to train and evaluate our linear regression model. 
# 
# The first dataset will be a synthetic dataset sampled from the following equations:
# 
# $$
# \epsilon \sim \text{Normal}(0, 3) \\
# y = 3x + 10 + \epsilon
# $$

# In[456]:


np.random.seed(0)
epsilon = np.random.normal(0, 3, 100)   # Sample epsilon from a Normal distribution
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)             # Sample x evenly between 0 and 100
y = 3 * x + 10 + epsilon


# Note that the above dataset satisfies all the assumptions of a linear regression model:
# - Linearity: $y$ is a linear (technically affine) function of $x$.
# - Independence: the $x$'s are independently drawn, and not dependent on each other.
# - Homoscedasticity: the $\epsilon$'s, and thus the $y$'s, have constant variance.
# - Normality: the $\epsilon$'s are drawn from a Normal distribution (i.e. Normally-distributed errors)
# 
# These properties, as well as the simplicity of this dataset, will make it a good test case to check if our linear regression model is working properly.

# **Plot y vs x in the synthetic dataset as a scatter plot. Label your axes and make sure your y-axis starts from 0.**

# In[458]:


fig = plt.figure()
plt.scatter(x,y)
ax = plt.gca()
ax.set_ylim([0,50])
plt.xlabel('x value')
plt.ylabel('y value')
plt.title('x vs y sample')
plt.show()


# The second dataset we will be using is an [auto MPG dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG). This dataset contains various characteristics for around 400 cars. We will use linear regression to predict the mpg label from seven features (4 continuous, 3 discrete).

# **From the visualizations above, do you think linear regression is a good model for this problem? Why and/or why not?**

# In[464]:


### Your answer here
'''
From the above, it appears many variables do have a linear relationship and are correlated to MPG, so
using linear regression could allow us to uncover the relationship between the variables and the target.
Further, we can look at the assumptions of the linear model
Linearity:  ùë¶  is a linear (technically affine) function of  ùë• .
Independence: the  ùë• s are independently drawn, and not dependent on each other.
Homoscedasticity: the  ùúñ s, and thus the  ùë¶ s, have constant variance.
Normality: the  ùúñ s are drawn from a Normal distribution (i.e. Normally-distributed errors)
We have not examined the indepence of the x, but we can say from the above visuals that each feature seems 
roughly normally distributed without massive outliers and satisfy the other conditions
'''


# ### 1.2 Data Pre-processing

# Before we can fit a linear regression model, there are several pre-processing steps we should apply to the datasets:
# 1. Encode categorial features appropriately.
# 2. Split the dataset into training (60%), validation (20%), and test (20%) sets.
# 3. Standardize the columns in the feature matrices X_train, X_val, and X_test to have zero mean and unit variance. To avoid information leakage, learn the standardization parameters (mean, variance) from X_train, and apply it to X_train, X_val, and X_test.
# 4. Add a column of ones to the feature matrices X_train, X_val, and X_test. This is a common trick so that we can learn a coefficient for the bias term of a linear model.
# 
# The processing steps on the synthetic dataset have been provided for you below as a reference:

# In[465]:


X = x.reshape((100, 1))   # Turn the x vector into a feature matrix X

# 1. No categorical features in the synthetic dataset (skip this step)

# 2. Split the dataset into training (60%), validation (20%), and test (20%) sets
X_dev, X_test, y_dev, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X_dev, y_dev, test_size=0.25, random_state=0)

# 3. Standardize the columns in the feature matrices
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)   # Fit and transform scalar on X_train
X_val = scaler.transform(X_val)           # Transform X_val
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)         # Transform X_test

# 4. Add a column of ones to the feature matrices
X_train = np.hstack([np.ones((X_train.shape[0], 1)), X_train])
X_val = np.hstack([np.ones((X_val.shape[0], 1)), X_val])
X_test = np.hstack([np.ones((X_test.shape[0], 1)), X_test])

# - Auto MPG dataset: auto_mpg_X_train, auto_mpg_X_val, auto_mpg_X_test, auto_mpg_y_train, auto_mpg_y_val, auto_mpg_y_test

# ### 1.3 Implement Linear Regression

# Now, we can implement our linear regression model! Specifically, we will be implementing ridge regression, which is linear regression with L2 regularization. Given an (m x n) feature matrix $X$, an (m x 1) label vector $y$, and an (n x 1) weight vector $w$, the hypothesis function for linear regression is:
# 
# $$
# y = X w
# $$
# 
# Note that we can omit the bias term here because we have included a column of ones in our $X$ matrix, so the bias term is learned implicitly as a part of $w$. This will make our implementation easier.
# 
# Our objective in linear regression is to learn the weights $w$ which best fit the data. This notion can be formalized as finding the optimal $w$ which minimizes the following loss function:
# 
# $$
# \min_{w} \| X w - y \|^2_2 + \alpha \| w \|^2_2 \\
# $$
# 
# This is the ridge regression loss function. The $\| X w - y \|^2_2$ term penalizes predictions $Xw$ which are not close to the label $y$. And the $\alpha \| w \|^2_2$ penalizes large weight values, to favor a simpler, more generalizable model. The $\alpha$ hyperparameter, known as the regularization parameter, is used to tune the complexity of the model - a higher $\alpha$ results in smaller weights and lower complexity, and vice versa. Setting $\alpha = 0$ gives us vanilla linear regression.
# 
# Conveniently, ridge regression has a closed-form solution which gives us the optimal $w$ without having to do iterative methods such as gradient descent. The closed-form solution, known as the Normal Equations, is given by:
# 
# $$
# w = (X^T X + \alpha I)^{-1} X^T y
# $$

# **Implement a `LinearRegression` class with two methods: `train` and `predict`.** You may NOT use sklearn for this implementation. You may, however, use `np.linalg.solve` to find the closed-form solution. It is highly recommended that you vectorize your code.

# ### 1.5 Tune Regularization Parameter $\alpha$

# Now, let's do ridge regression and tune the $\alpha$ regularization parameter on the auto MPG dataset.
# 
# **Sweep out values for $\alpha$ using `alphas = np.logspace(-2, 1, 10)`. Perform a grid search over these $\alpha$ values, recording the training and validation MSEs for each $\alpha$. A simple grid search is fine, no need for k-fold cross validation. Plot the training and validation MSEs as a function of $\alpha$ on a single figure. Make sure to label the axes and the training and validation MSE curves. Use a log scale for the x-axis.**

# **Explain your plot above. How do training and validation MSE behave with decreasing model complexity (increasing $\alpha$)?**

# In[476]:


### Your answer here

'''
MSE increases for both training and validation as alpha increases. This makes sense as we keep the model simpler, in general
the MSE will be higher. As alpha increases further, eventually MSE for training and validation will be about the same
since the model will be effectively guessing. You can start to see that in the above graph as MSE validation starts 
higher but increases at a slower rate

# ### 2.2 Data Pre-processing

# **Apply the following pre-processing steps to the breast cancer dataset:**
# 
# 1. Encode the categorical label as 0 (B) or 1 (M).
# 2. Convert the label from a Pandas series to a Numpy (m x 1) vector. If you don't do this, it may cause problems when implementing the logistic regression model (certain broadcasting operations may fail unexpectedly).
# 2. Split the dataset into training (60%), validation (20%), and test (20%) sets.
# 3. Standardize the columns in the feature matrices cancer_X_train, cancer_X_val, and cancer_X_test to have zero mean and unit variance. To avoid information leakage, learn the standardization parameters (mean, variance) from cancer_X_train, and apply it to cancer_X_train, cancer_X_val, and cancer_X_test.
# 4. Add a column of ones to the feature matrices cancer_X_train, cancer_X_val, and cancer_X_test. This is a common trick so that we can learn a coefficient for the bias term of a linear model.
# 

# At the end of this pre-processing, you should have the following vectors and matrices: cancer_X_train, cancer_X_val, cancer_X_test, cancer_y_train, cancer_y_val, cancer_y_test.

# We will now implement logistic regression with L2 regularization. Given an (m x n) feature matrix $X$, an (m x 1) label vector $y$, and an (n x 1) weight vector $w$, the hypothesis function for logistic regression is:
# 
# $$
# y = \sigma(X w)
# $$
# 
# where $\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$, i.e. the sigmoid function. This function scales the prediction to be a probability between 0 and 1, and can then be thresholded to get a discrete class prediction.
# 
# Just as with linear regression, our objective in logistic regression is to learn the weights $ùë§$ which best fit the data. For L2-regularized logistic regression, we find an optimal $w$ to minimize the following loss function:
# 
# $$
# \min_{w} \ -y^T \ \text{log}(\sigma(Xw)) \ - \  (\mathbf{1} - y)^T \ \text{log}(\mathbf{1} - \sigma(Xw)) \ + \ \alpha \| w \|^2_2 \\
# $$
# 
# Unlike linear regression, however, logistic regression has no closed-form solution for the optimal $w$. So, we will use gradient descent to find the optimal $w$. The (n x 1) gradient vector $g$ for the loss function above is:
# 
# $$
# g = X^T \Big(\sigma(Xw) - y\Big) + 2 \alpha w
# $$
# 
# Below is pseudocode for gradient descent to find the optimal $w$. You should first initialize $w$ (e.g. to a (n x 1) zero vector). Then, for some number of epochs $t$, you should update $w$ with $w - \eta g $, where $\eta$ is the learning rate and $g$ is the gradient. You can learn more about gradient descent [here](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/machine-learning/gradient-descent-8SpIM).
# 
# > $w = \mathbf{0}$
# > 
# > $\text{for } i = 1, 2, ..., t$
# >
# > $\quad \quad w = w - \eta g $
# 

# **Implement a `LogisticRegression` class with five methods: `train`, `predict`, `calculate_loss`, `calculate_gradient`, and `calculate_sigmoid`.** You may NOT use sklearn for this implementation. It is highly recommended that you vectorize your code.

# ### 2.5 Tune Regularization Parameter  ùõº

# Now, we will observe the effect of tuning the regularization parameter $\alpha$ on the learned weights of the model.

# **Sweep out values for $\alpha$ using `alphas = np.logspace(-2, 2, 100)`. For each $\alpha$ value, train a logistic regression model and record its weights. Plot the weights for each feature as a function of $\alpha$ on a single figure. Make sure to label the axes.** You should have 31 curves (one for each feature) in the plot.

# In[490]:


### Your code here
alphas =  np.logspace(-2, 2, 100)
weights = pd.DataFrame(columns=feature_names)
weight_curr = []
for alpha in alphas:
    model = LogisticRegression(alpha=alpha)
    model.train(cancer_X_train,cancer_y_train)
    weight_curr = pd.DataFrame(model.w.T, columns=feature_names)
    weights = weights.append(weight_curr)

    


# In[491]:


#weights.T.plot()
weights['alpha'] = alphas
ax = weights.set_index('alpha').plot()
ax.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.0,1.0))
ax.set_ylabel('coefficient')
ax.set_title('coefficient value vs alpha across features')
ax.plot()


# **Describe the effect of the regularization parameter $\alpha$ on the weights of your model. Please explain in terms of model complexity.**

# In[492]:


### Your answer here

'''
Higher values of alpha leads to smaller values of coefficients for different features - with some features at zero
coefficient or very small, we are reducing our model complexity (fewer features matter).
